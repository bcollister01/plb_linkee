       "'Apple Inc is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics software and online services Apple is the largest information technology company by revenue totaling US 365 8 billion in 2021 and as of January 2021 it is the worlds most valuable company the fourth largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second largest mobile phone manufacturer It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies alongside Alphabet Amazon Meta and Microsoft Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1 1976 by Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniaks Apple I personal computer It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer Inc in 1977 and the companys next computer the Apple II became a best seller Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces including the original Macintosh announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement 1984 directed by Ridley Scott By 1985 the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably while Jobs resigned to found NeXT taking some Apple employees with him As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s Apple lost considerable market share to the lower priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel powered PC clones also known as Wintel In 1997 weeks away from bankruptcy the company bought NeXT to resolve Apples unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company Over the next decade Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac iPod iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim launching memorable advertising campaigns opening the Apple Store retail chain and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the companys product portfolio Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons and died two months later He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook Apple became the first publicly traded U S company to be valued at over 1 trillion in August 2018 then 2 trillion in August 2020 and most recently 3 trillion in January 2022 The company sometimes receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors its environmental practices and its business ethics including anti competitive practices and materials sourcing Nevertheless the company enjoys a high level of brand loyalty and is ranked as one of the worlds most valuable brands Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1 1976 by Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne as a business partnership The companys first product was the Apple I a computer designed and hand built entirely by Wozniak To finance its creation Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation a VW Bus for a few hundred dollars and Wozniak sold his HP 65 calculator for US 500 equivalent to 2 381 in 2021 Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976 The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU RAM and basic textual video chips a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer It went on sale soon after debut for US 666 66 equivalent to 3 175 in 2021 180 Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666 and that he came up with the price because he liked repeating digits Apple Computer Inc was incorporated on January 3 1977 without Wayne who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for 800 only twelve days after having co founded Apple Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of US 250 000 equivalent to 1 117 930 in 2021 to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple During the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially doubling about every four months Between September 1977 and September 1980 yearly sales grew from 775 000 to 118 million an average annual growth rate of 533% The Apple II also invented by Wozniak was introduced on April 16 1977 at the first West Coast Computer Faire It differed from its major rivals the TRS 80 and Commodore PET because of its character cell based color graphics and open architecture While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 1⁄4 inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978 The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer application of the business world VisiCalc a spreadsheet program released in 1979 VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II compatibility with the office Before VisiCalc Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy By the end of the 1970s Apple had become the leading computer manufacturer in the United States On December 12 1980 Apple ticker symbol AAPL went public selling 4 6 million shares at 22 per share 39 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of March 30 2019 generating over 100 million which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956 By the end of the day 300 millionaires were created from a stock price of 29 per share and a market cap of 1 778 billion A critical moment in the companys history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto a computer using a graphical user interface Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100 000 shares 5 6 million split adjusted shares as of March 30 2019 of Apple at the pre IPO price of 10 a share After the demonstration Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa named after Jobss daughter The Lisa division would be plagued by infighting and in 1982 Jobs was pushed off the project The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software titles Jobs angered by being pushed off the Lisa team took over the companys Macintosh division Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as low cost computer with a text based interface like the Apple II but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa undercutting his former division Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division which at the time generated most of the companys revenue In 1984 Apple launched the Macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language Its debut was signified by 1984 a 1 5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22 1984 This is now hailed as a watershed event for Apples success and was called a masterpiece by CNN and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide The advertisement created great interest in the original Macintosh and sales were initially good but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in Jobs had made the decision to equip the original Macintosh with 128 kilobytes of RAM attempting to reach a US 1 000 equivalent to 2 608 in 2021 price point which limited its speed and the software that could be used The Macintosh would eventually ship for US 2 495 equivalent to 6 508 in 2021 a price panned by critics in light of its slow performance 195 In early 1985 this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs using the famous line Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world Sculley decided to remove Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products Rather than submit to Sculleys direction Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple Informed by Jean Louis Gassée Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apples executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took a number of Apple employees with him to found NeXT Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures expressing his frustration with Apples treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had been going in the wrong direction for the last five years Despite Wozniaks grievances he officially remained employed by Apple and to this day continues to work for the company as a representative receiving a stipend estimated to be 120 000 per year for this role Both Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders after their departures After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak Sculley worked to improve the Macintosh in 1985 by quadrupling the RAM and introducing the LaserWriter the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer PageMaker an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985 It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh LaserWriter and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market This dominant position in the desktop publishing market allowed the company to focus on higher price points the so called high right policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the high right policy was in full force by the mid 1980s notably due to Jean Louis Gassées mantra of fifty five or die referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II 79–80 This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on PC clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high priced products The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the companys history to have declining sales which led to a 20% drop in Apples stock price 117–129 During this period the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer Gassée left the company later that year The company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower cost models the Macintosh Classic the Macintosh LC and the Macintosh IIsi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand In 1991 Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops The same year Apple introduced System 7 a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities The success of the lower cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue For some time Apple was doing incredibly well introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the first golden age of the Macintosh The success of Apples lower cost consumer models especially the LC also led to the cannibalization of their higher priced machines To address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets the high end Quadra models the mid range Centris line and the consumer marketed Performa series This led to significant market confusion as customers did not understand the difference between models The early 1990s also saw the discontinuation of the Apple II series which was expensive to produce and the company felt was still taking sales away from lower cost Macintosh models After the launch of the LC Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II and authorized salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993 Throughout this period Microsoft continued to gain market share with its Windows graphical user interface that it sold to manufacturers of generally less expensive PC clones While the Macintosh was more expensive it offered a more tightly integrated user experience but the company struggled to make the case to consumers Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s including digital cameras portable CD audio players speakers video game consoles the eWorld online service and TV appliances Most notably enormous resources were invested in the problem plagued Newton tablet division based on John Sculleys unrealistic market forecasts Throughout this period Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response instead they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in Apple Computer Inc v Microsoft Corp The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apples reputation and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler With Spindler at the helm Apple IBM and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform the PowerPC Reference Platform PReP which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software The AIM alliance hoped that PRePs performance and Apples software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows The same year Apple introduced the Power Macintosh the first of many Apple computers to use Motorolas PowerPC processor In the wake of the alliance Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones Over the next two years 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced However by 1996 Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high end computers where profit margins were highest In 1996 Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator Amelio made deep changes including extensive layoffs and cost cutting This period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system MacOS The original Macintosh operating system System 1 was not built for multitasking running several applications at once The company attempted to correct this with by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5 but the company still felt it needed a more modern approach This led to the Pink project in 1988 A/UX that same year Copland in 1994 and the attempted purchase of BeOS in 1996 Talks with Be stalled the CEO former Apple executive Jean Louis Gassée demanded 300 million instead of the 125 million Apple wanted to pay Only weeks away from bankruptcy Apples board decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice for its next operating system and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for 429 million bringing back Apple co founder Steve Jobs The NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9 1997 and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor On July 9 1997 Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelios resignation after overseeing a three year record low stock price and crippling financial losses The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the companys products Jobs would order 70% of the companys products to be cancelled resulting in the loss of 3 000 jobs and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings The next month in August 1997 Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a 150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac The investment was seen as an antitrust insurance policy for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti competitive practices Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997 purchased the largest clone maker Power Computing On November 10 1997 Apple introduced the Apple Store website which was tied to a new build to order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell The moves paid off for Jobs at the end of his first year as CEO the company turned a 309 million profit On May 6 1998 Apple introduced a new all in one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh the iMac The iMac was a huge success for Apple selling 800 000 units in its first five months and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3½ inch diskette being an early adopter of the USB connector and coming pre installed with internet connectivity the i in iMac via Ethernet and a dial up modem The device also had a striking eardrop shape and translucent materials designed by Jonathan Ive who although hired by Amelio would go on to work collaboratively with Jobs for the next decade to chart a new course the design of Apples products A little more than a year later on July 21 1999 Apple introduced the iBook a laptop for consumers It was the culmination of a strategy established by Jobs to produce only four products refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals along with the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers Jobs felt the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation At around the same time Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers Apple acquired of Macromedias Key Grip digital video editing software project which was renamed Final Cut Pro when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999 The development of Key Grip also led to Apples release of the consumer video editing product iMovie in October 1999 Next Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000 which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector which Apple would sell as the professional oriented DVD Studio Pro software product and used the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market In 2000 Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene Apple renamed the program iTunes while simplifying the user interface and adding the ability to burn CDs 2001 would be a pivotal year for the Apple with the company making three announcements that would change the course of the company The first announcement came on March 24 2001 that Apple was nearly ready to release a new modern operating system Mac OS X The announcement came after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s and several years of development Mac OS X was based on NeXTSTEP OPENSTEP and BSD Unix with Apple aiming to combine the stability reliability and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface heavily influenced by NeXTSTEP To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9 the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment In May 2001 the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California offering an improved presentation of the companys products At the time many speculated that the stores would fail but they went on to become highly successful and the first of more than 500 stores around the world On October 23 2001 Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player The product which was first sold on November 10 2001 was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years In 2003 Apples iTunes Store was introduced The service offered music downloads for 0 99 a song and integration with the iPod The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services with over five billion downloads by June 19 2008 Two years later the iTunes Store was the worlds largest music retailer In 2002 Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company The acquisition was followed by the development of Apples consumer level GarageBand application The release of iPhoto in the same year completed the iLife suite At the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6 2005 Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006 On January 10 2006 the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intels Core Duo CPU By August 7 2006 Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line over one year sooner than announced The Power Mac iBook and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition the Mac Pro MacBook and MacBook Pro became their respective successors On April 29 2009 The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X Apples success during this period was evident in its stock price Between early 2003 and 2006 the price of Apples stock increased more than tenfold from around 6 per share split adjusted to over 80 When Apple surpassed Dells market cap in January 2006 Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dells CEO Michael Dell should eat his words Nine years prior Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007 Jobs announced that Apple Computer Inc would thereafter be known as Apple Inc because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone and the Apple TV The company sold 270 000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales and the device was called a game changer for the industry In an article posted on Apples website on February 6 2007 Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management DRM thereby allowing tracks to be played on third party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology On April 2 2007 Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMIs catalog in the iTunes Store effective in May 2007 Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM In July 2008 Apple launched the App Store to sell third party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch Within a month the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of 1 million with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion dollar business for Apple By October 2008 Apple was the third largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone On January 14 2009 Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health In the email Jobs stated that the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family but everyone else at Apple as well and explained that the break would allow the company to focus on delivering extraordinary products Though Jobs was absent Apple recorded its best non holiday quarter Q1 FY 2009 during the recession with revenue of 8 16 billion and profit of 1 21 billion After years of speculation and multiple rumored leaks Apple unveiled a large screen tablet like media device known as the iPad on January 27 2010 The iPad ran the same touch based operating system as the iPhone and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch though having very little development time before the release Later that year on April 3 2010 the iPad was launched in the US It sold more than 300 000 units on its first day and 500 000 by the end of the first week In May of the same year Apples market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989 In June 2010 Apple released the iPhone 4 which introduced video calling using FaceTime multitasking and a new uninsulated stainless steel design that acted as the phones antenna Later that year Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi touch iPod Nano an iPod Touch with FaceTime and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations It also introduced the smaller cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows On January 17 2011 Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook assumed Jobss day to day operations at Apple although Jobs would still remain involved in major strategic decisions Apple became the most valuable consumer facing brand in the world In June 2011 Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud an online storage and syncing service for music photos files and software which replaced MobileMe Apples previous attempt at content syncing This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death On August 24 2011 Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apples chairman Apple did not have a chairman at the time and instead had two co lead directors Andrea Jung and Arthur D Levinson who continued with those titles until Levinson replaced Jobs as chairman of the board in November after Jobs death On October 5 2011 Steve Jobs died marking the end of an era for Apple The first major product announcement by Apple following Jobss passing occurred on January 19 2012 when Apples Phil Schiller introduced iBooks Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City Jobs

software assistant named Siri and cloud synced data with iCloud the third and fourth generation iPads which featured Retina displays and the iPad Mini which featured a 7 9 inch screen in contrast to the iPads 9 7 inch screen These launches were successful with the iPhone 5 released September 21 2012 becoming Apples biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre orders and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth generation iPad released November 3 2012 Apple also released a third generation 13 inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers On August 20 2012 Apples rising stock price increased the companys market capitalization to a then record 624 billion This beat the non inflation adjusted record for market capitalization previously set by Microsoft in 1999 On August 24 2012 a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple 1 05 billion £665m in damages in an intellectual property lawsuit Samsung appealed the damages award which was reduced by 450 million and further granted Samsungs request for a new trial On November 10 2012 Apple confirmed a global settlement that dismissed all existing lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date in favor of a ten year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies It is predicted that Apple will make 280 million a year from this deal with HTC In May 2014 the company confirmed its intent to acquire Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovines audio company Beats Electronics producer of the Beats by Dr Dre line of headphones and speaker products and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music for 3 billion and to sell their products through Apples retail outlets and resellers Iovine believed that Beats had always belonged with Apple as the company modeled itself after Apples unmatched ability to marry culture and technology The acquisition was the largest purchase in Apples history During a press event on September 9 2014 Apple introduced a smartwatch the Apple Watch Initially Apple marketed the device as a fashion accessory and a complement to the iPhone that would allow people to look at their smartphones less Over time the company has focused on developing health and fitness oriented features on the watch in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers In January 2016 it was announced that one billion Apple devices were in active use worldwide On June 6 2016 Fortune released Fortune 500 their list of companies ranked on revenue generation In the trailing fiscal year 2015 Apple appeared on

speech on June 22 2020 Apple announced it would move away from Intel processors and the Mac would transition to processors developed in house The announcement was expected by industry analysts and it has been noted that Macs featuring Apples processors would allow for big increases in performance over current Intel based models On November 10 2020 the MacBook Air MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini became the first Mac devices powered by an Apple designed processor the Apple M1 In April 2022 it was reported that Samsung Electro Mechanics would be collaborating with Apple on its M2 chip instead of LG Innotek Developer logs showed that at least nine Mac models with four different M2 chips were being tested The Wall Street Journal reported that an effort to develop its own chips left Apple better prepared to deal with the semiconductor shortage that emerged during the pandemic era and led to increased profitability with sales of Mac computers that included M1 chips rising sharply in 2020 and 2021 It also inspired other companies like Tesla Amazon and Meta Platforms to pursue a similar path In April 2022 Apple opened an online store that allowed anyone in the US to view repair manuals and order replacement parts for specific recent iPhones although the difference in cost between this method and official repair is anticipated to be minimal Macintosh commonly known as Mac is Apples line of personal computers that use the companys proprietary macOS operating system Personal computers were Apples original business line but as of the end of 2021 they account for only about 10 percent of the companys revenue The company is in the process of switching Mac computers from Intel processors to Apple silicon a custom designed system on a chip platform As of March 2022 there

is credited with helping to make Apple one of the worlds most valuable publicly traded companies As of the end of 2021 the iPhone accounts for more than half of the companys revenue As of January 2022 33 iPhone models have been produced with five smartphone families in production iPhone 13 iPhone 13 Pro iPhone SE 3rd generation iPhone 12 iPhone 11 iPad is Apples line of tablet computers that use the companys proprietary iPadOS operating system derived from macOS and iOS The first generation iPad was announced on January 27 2010 The iPad took the multi touch user interface first introduced in the iPhone and adapted it to a larger screen marked for interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers books photos videos music documents video games and most existing iPhone apps Earlier generations of the iPad used the same iOS operating system as the companys smartphones before being split off in 2019 As of September 2020 Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads though sales peaked in 2013 However the iPad remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020 and accounted for nine percent of the companys revenue as of the end of 2021 In recent years Apple has started offering more powerful versions of the device with the current iPad Pro sharing the same Apple silicon as Macintosh computers along with a smaller version of the device called iPad mini and an upgraded version called iPad Air As of January 2022 there are four iPad families in production iPad 9th generation iPad mini 6th generation iPad Pro 5th generation iPad Air 5th generation Apple also makes several other products that it categorizes as Wearables Home and Accessories These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones Apple TV digital media players Apple Watch smartwatches Beats headphones HomePod Mini smart speakers and the iPod touch the last remaining device in Apples successful line of iPod portable media players As of the end of 2021 this broad line of products comprises about 11% of the companys revenues Apple also offers a broad line of services that it earns revenue on including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app the AppleCare extended warranty plan the iCloud cloud based data storage service payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform a digital content services including Apple Books Apple Fitness Apple Music Apple News Apple TV and the iTunes Store As of the end of 2021 services comprise about 19% of the companys revenue Many of the services have been launched since 2019 when Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues According to Steve Jobs the companys name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet Jobs thought the name Apple was fun spirited and not intimidating Apples first designed by Ron Wayne depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoffs rainbow Apple the now familiar rainbow colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the bitten and Jobs immediately took a liking to it However Jobs insisted that the be colorized to humanize the company The was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry The colored stripes were conceived to make the more accessible and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color This is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the On August 27 1999 the year following the introduction of the iMac G3 Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic s nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation An Aqua themed version of the monochrome was used from 1998 to 2003 and a glass themed version was used from 2007 to 2013 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles but Apple Inc had name and trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968 This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007 Apples first slogan Byte into an Apple was coined in the late 1970s From 1997 to 2002 the slogan Think Different was used in advertising campaigns and is still closely associated with Apple Apple also has slogans for specific product lines for example iThink therefore iMac was used in 1998 to promote the iMac and Say hello to iPhone has been used in iPhone advertisements Hello was also used to introduce the original Macintosh Newton iMac hello again and iPod From the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products However claims made by later campaigns were criticized particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads Apples product advertisements gained a lot of attention as a result of their eye popping graphics and catchy tunes Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song 1234 and Yael Naïm with the song New Soul Apple customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty early in the companys history In 1984 BYTE stated that There are two kinds of people in the world people who say Apple isnt just a company its a cause and people who say Apple isnt a cause its just a company Both groups are right Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power once reserved for big corporations to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets The companys growth from two guys to a billion dollar corporation exemplifies the American Dream Even as a large corporation Apple plays David to IBMs Goliath and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth Apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism something that was stumbled upon while Ive explained in 2014 that People have an incredibly personal relationship with Apples products Apple Store openings and new product releases can draw crowds of hundreds with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening The opening of New York Citys Apple Fifth Avenue store in 2006 was highly attended and had visitors from Europe who flew in for the event In June 2017 a newlywed couple took their wedding photos inside the then recently opened Orchard Road Apple Store in Singapore The high level of brand loyalty has been criticized and ridiculed applying the epithet Apple fanboy and mocking the lengthy lines before a product launch An internal memo leaked in 2015 suggested the company planned to discourage long lines and direct customers to purchase its products on its website Fortune magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008 and in the world from 2008 to 2012 On September 30 2013 Apple surpassed Coca Cola to become the worlds most valuable brand in the Omnicom Groups Best Global Brands report Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the worlds most innovative brand every year since 2005 The New York Times in 1985 stated that Apple above all else is a marketing company John Sculley agreed telling The Guardian newspaper in 1997 that People talk about technology but Apple was a marketing company It was the marketing company of the decade Research in 2002 by NetRatings indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc products were more expensive than other PC products In response to a query about the devotion of loyal Apple consumers Jonathan Ive responded What people are responding to is much bigger than the object They are responding to something rare a group of people who do more than simply make something work they make the very best products they possibly can Its a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness As of January 2021 there are 1 65 billion Apple products in active use Apple Inc s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino in the middle of Californias Silicon Valley at Apple Park a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile 1 6 km The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12 000 employees Apple co founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal in his final public appearance before his death Apple also operates from the Apple Campus also known by its address 1 Infinite Loop a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850 000 square feet 79 000 m2 located about 1 mile 1 6 km to the west of Apple Park The Apple Campus was the companys headquarters from its opening in 1993 until the opening of Apple Park in 2017 The buildings located at 1–6 Infinite Loop are arranged in a circular pattern around a central green space in a design that has been compared to that of a university In addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino including three buildings that also served as prior headquarters Stephens Creek Three 1977–1978 Bandley One 1978–1982 and Mariani One 1982–1993 In total Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city Apples headquarters for Europe the Middle East and Africa EMEA are located in Cork in the south of Ireland called the Hollyhill campus The facility which opened in 1980 houses 5 500 people and was Apples first location outside of the United States Apples international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork Apple has two campuses near Austin Texas a 216 000 square foot 20 100 m2 campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon and a 1 1 million square foot 100 000 m2 campus opened in 2021 where 6 000 people to work in technical support supply chain management online store curation and Apple Maps data management The company also has several other locations in Boulder Colo Culver City Calif Herzliya Israel London New York Pittsburgh San Diego and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then CEO Steve Jobs after years of attempting but failing store within a store concepts Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the companys products he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000 Jobs relaunched Apples online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001 The media initially speculated that Apple would fail but its stores were highly successful bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US 1 billion in annual sales becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so Over the years Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017 Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top tier retail stores with sales over 16 billion globally in 2011 In May 2016 Angela Ahrendts Apples then Senior Vice President of Retail unveiled a significantly redesigned Apple Store in Union Square San Francisco featuring large glass doors for the entry open spaces and re branded rooms In addition to purchasing products consumers can get advice and help from Creative Pros – individuals with specialized knowledge of creative arts get product support in a tree lined Genius Grove and attend sessions conferences and community events with Ahrendts commenting that the goal is to make Apple Stores into town squares a place where people naturally meet up and spend time The new design will be applied to all Apple Stores worldwide a process that has seen stores temporarily relocate or close Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls but Apple has built several stand alone flagship stores in high profile locations It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores designs and construction specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers who have lost traffic control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores Apples notable brand loyalty among consumers causes long lines of hundreds of people at new Apple Store openings or product releases Due to the popularity of the brand Apple receives a large number of job applications many of which come from young workers Although Apple Store employees receive above average pay are offered money toward education and health care and receive product discounts there are limited or no paths of career advancement A May 2016 report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a hostile work environment with harassment from customers intense internal criticism and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts Due to the COVID 19 pandemic Apple closed its stores outside China until March 27 2020 Despite the stores being closed hourly workers continue to be paid Workers across the company are allowed to work remotely if their jobs permit it On March 24 2020 in a memo Senior Vice President of People and Retail Deirdre O’Brien announced that some of its retail stores are expected to reopen at the beginning of April Apple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company By the time of the 1984 television advertisement Apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors According to a 2011 report in Fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation In a 2017 interview Wozniak credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions while in his youth as a source of inspiration for his co founding Apple As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character Nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after Jobs returned to the company Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobss involvement often took longer than projects with it To recognize the best of its employees Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including Bill Atkinson Steve Capps Rod Holt Alan Kay Guy Kawasaki Al Alcorn Don Norman Rich Page Steve Wozniak and Phil Schiller At Apple employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise Jobs saw this as a means of having best in class employees in every role For instance Ron Johnson Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1 2011 was responsible for site selection in store service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores This was done by Tim Cook who had a background in supply chain management Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability Each project has a directly responsible individual or DRI in Apple jargon As an example when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apples official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app he was forced to resign Unlike other major U S companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year In 2015 Apple had 110 000 full time employees This increased to 116 000 full time employees the next year a notable hiring decrease largely due to its first revenue decline Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail though its 2014 SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base In September 2017 Apple announced that it had over 123 000 full time employees Apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy and has an anti leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Secret Service In December 2017 Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009 peaking at rank 10 in 2012 and falling down the ranks in subsequent years Lack of innovation An editorial article in The Verge in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the publics perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years specifically stating that Samsung has matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole stating Yes iteration is boring But its also how Apple does business It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success He acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony Furthermore he writes that a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that Walkman did not have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the iCloud cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device as well as inter connected device functionality including Auto Unlock in which an Apple Watch can unlock a Mac in close proximity He argues that Apples ecosystem is its greatest innovation The Wall Street Journal reported in June 2017 that Apples increased reliance on Siri its virtual personal assistant has raised questions about how much Apple can actually accomplish in terms of functionality Whereas Google and Amazon make use of big data and analyze customer information to personalize results Apple has a strong pro privacy stance intentionally not retaining user data Siri is a textbook of leading on something in tech and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley Holger Mueller a technology analyst told the Journal The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors a lack of ambitious goals and shifting strategies Though switching Siris functions to machine learning and algorithms which dramatically cut its error rate the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazons Echo which features the Alexa personal assistant Improvements to Siri stalled executives clashed and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third party app interactions While Apple acquired an England based startup specializing in conversational assistants Googles Assistant had already become capable of helping users select Wi Fi networks by voice and Siri was lagging in functionality In December 2017 two articles from The Verge and ZDNet debated what had been a particularly devastating week for Apples macOS and iOS software platforms The former had experienced a severe security vulnerability in which Macs running the then latest macOS High Sierra software were vulnerable to a bug that let anyone gain administrator privileges by entering root as the username in system prompts leaving the password field empty and twice clicking unlock gaining full access The bug was publicly disclosed on Twitter rather than through proper bug bounty programs Apple released a security fix within a day and issued an apology stating that regrettably we stumbled in regards to the security of the latest updates After installing the security patch however file sharing was broken for users with Apple releasing a support document with instructions to separately fix that issue Though Apple publicly stated the promise of auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again users who installed the security update while running the older 10 13 0 version of the High Sierra operating system rather than the then newest 10 13 1 release experienced that the root security vulnerability was re introduced and persisted even after fully updating their systems On iOS a date bug caused iOS devices that received local app notifications at 12 15am on December 2 2017 to repeatedly restart Users were recommended to turn off notifications for their apps Apple quickly released an update done during the nighttime in Cupertino California time and outside of their usual software release window with one of the headlining features of the update needing to be delayed for a few days The combined problems of the week on both macOS and iOS caused The Verges Tom Warren to call it a nightmare for Apples software engineers and described it as a significant lapse in Apples ability to protect its more than 1 billion devices ZDNets Adrian Kingsley Hughes wrote that its hard to not come away from the last week with the feeling that Apple is slipping Kingsley Hughes also concluded his piece by referencing an earlier article in which he wrote that As much as I dont want to bring up the tired old Apple wouldnt have done this under Steve Jobss watch trope a lot of whats happening at Apple lately is different from what they came to expect under Jobs Not to say that things didnt go wrong under his watch but product announcements and launches felt a lot tighter for sure as did the overall quality of what Apple was releasing He did however also acknowledge that such failures may indeed have happened with Jobs in charge though returning to the previous praise for his demands of quality stating its almost guaranteed that given his personality that heads would have rolled which limits future failures The companys manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profit sapping inventories In 2011 Apples profit margins were 40 percent compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies Cooks catchphrase to describe his focus on the companys operational arm is Nobody wants to buy sour milk In May 2017 the company announced a 1 billion funding project for advanced manufacturing in the United States and subsequently invested 200 million in Corning Inc a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in its iPhone devices The following December Apples chief operating officer Jeff Williams told CNBC that the 1 billion amount was absolutely not the final limit on its spending elaborating that Were not thinking in terms of a fund limit Were thinking about where are the opportunities across the U S to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that that quite frankly is essential to our innovation As of 2021 Apple uses components from 43 countries The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn Pegatron Wistron and Compal Electronics mostly in factories located inside China but also Brazil and India During the Macs early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with Apples adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB AGP HyperTransport Wi Fi NVMe PCIe and others in its products FireWire is an Apple originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market In July 2012 during a conference call with investors CEO Tim Cook said that he loves India but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region Indias requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as really adds cost to getting product to market In May 2016 Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4 000 staff in Hyderabad In March The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India over the next two months and in May the Journal wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country while Apple told CNBC that the manufacturing was for a small number of units In April 2019 Apple initiated manufacturing of iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India At the beginning of 2020 Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021 while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year'"
